# Brain Tumor Detection using ResNet-50 and Flask

This project is a web-based Brain Tumor Detection system that utilizes deep learning with **ResNet-50** for MRI image classification. The model is trained using TensorFlow and deployed using Flask.

## 📌 Features
- **Deep Learning Model:** Uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 model fine-tuned for MRI image classification.
- **Web Interface:** Allows users to upload MRI images for real-time tumor detection.
- **Flask Backend:** Handles image processing, model inference, and response generation.
- **Interactive UI:** Drag-and-drop & file upload functionality with a clean, modern design.
